Welcome to the Fake News Headline Generator — a beginner-friendly Python project that’s all about creativity and fun!

What’s This All About?
This mini project is a simple Python program that randomly generates fictional news headlines, using Indian names, groups, and places for a fun twist. It’s a great way to get started with Python — no heavy theory, just pure creativity and code!
Each time you run the app, it prints out a new "BREAKING NEWS" headline that sounds wild, weird, and often hilarious. And the best part? You can keep generating as many as you like!

Key Concepts-
This project helps to practice core Python concepts in a super fun way:
Lists – for storing subjects, actions, and places.
The random module – to pick something surprising each time.
While loops – so you can keep generating until you're done laughing.
User input – letting you control when to stop.
String formatting with f-strings – to neatly stitch together the headline.

Sample Headline
BREAKING NEWS: A group of musicians saves the world in a crowded stadium.
Sounds wild, right? That’s the idea!

Why It’s Cool
Perfect for beginners trying to get hands-on with Python.
Easy to understand, fun to use, and very customizable.
Can be extended with a GUI, text-to-speech, or social media sharing.


# 2. Calculator with History

Welcome to the Calculator with History – a beginner-friendly Python project that lets users perform basic calculations while keeping track of their previous operations. This is more than just a calculator — it's a smart little tool that remembers your math!

Project Overview-
This Python project allows users to enter mathematical expressions (like 5 + 3 or 12 * 4) and immediately get results. It also stores each calculation in a history file so users can view past operations. With options to view history, clear history, or exit, it’s a neat and practical command-line utility for everyday calculations.

Features-
Input mathematical expressions (+, -, *, /),
Automatically stores each calculation in a .txt file,
Loop-based structure allows continuous usage,
View full calculation history any time,
Clear saved history with one command,
Option to safely exit the program,

This project is a great way to practice and understand core Python skills:
input() – to take user commands or expressions,
Functions – to organize tasks like calculating, viewing history, or clearing it,
Conditional statements (if-else) – to decide what to do based on user choice,
Loops (while) – to keep the calculator running until the user decides to exit,
File handling – to save and retrieve history using open(), read(), write().


# 3. Password Guessing Game

Welcome to the Password Guessing Game — a fun, beginner-level Python game where your mission is to guess the secret word chosen by the computer. It’s simple, challenging, and a great way to learn core Python concepts in an interactive way!

What’s the Game About?
The computer secretly picks a word (like "banana"), and your job is to guess what it is. After each guess, the program gives you a helpful hint — such as how many letters are correct and in the right place. The game continues until you crack the password!
You’ll also see how many attempts it took you, and if you’re feeling adventurous, you can choose a difficulty level for shorter or longer words.

How It Works-
The program randomly selects a secret word.
It tells the user how many letters the word contains.
You start guessing the word.
After each guess:
If your guess is correct, the game congratulates you and shows the number of attempts.
If it’s not correct, the game gives you a hint (e.g., “2 letters are correct and in the correct place”).
The game keeps going until you guess it right!
Bonus: You can choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) to make things more interesting.

Key Concepts-
This game helps build strong Python fundamentals in a super engaging way:
Loops – keep the game running until the user wins,
Strings – compare user input with the secret password,
Conditionals – check if the guess is correct, and give hints,
Variables – track number of attempts, user input,
Lists – store a word bank for the computer to choose from,
Random module – to randomly select words from the list,

Features-
Word guessing with helpful hints,
Tracks number of attempts,
Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard,
Text-based, simple command-line interface,
Beginner-friendly and fully functional.
